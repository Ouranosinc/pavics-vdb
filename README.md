# PAVICS Virtual Database

Create a virtual layer of netCDF datasets using NcML aggregation files. These datasets are hosted on THREDDS, which can then serve aggregated datasets. This is useful not only to concatenate files split by time periods, but also combine variables or ensemble realizations. The NcML layer is also useful to add or fix metadata attributes to ensure consistency, compliance with conventions and facilitate search queries.
