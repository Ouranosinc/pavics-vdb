In order to meet this growing demand and to ensure the availability of climate scenarios responding to numerous vulnerability, impact and adaptation (VIA) studies, Ouranos is working to create a set of operational bias-adjusted climate simulations called \"Ensemble de simulations post-traitées d’Ouranos” (ESPO) covering North America.",
