# PAVICS Catalog

We want catalogs to access datasets used in the production of climate services. 

## Catalog granularity

One question is whether we want specialized catalogs, for example for reanalyses or regional simulations, or if we prefer one big catalog storing everything. 

Although putting everything together is practical, it might become difficult to navigate since some columns will only apply to some datasets but not others. In other words, as we mix different types of data, the attribute table becomes more sparse. 

Maybe a strategy would be to select attribute values for different types of data, and then see whether or not it makes sense to combine them. 


## Attributes and controlled vocabulary

### Simulations
CMIP, CORDEX vocabulary for file name
CMIP5 DRS: https://www.medcordex.eu/cmip5_data_reference_syntax.pdf
Should we split into project ? CMIP5 / CMIP6 / CORDEX
Should we split into regional vs global ?

### Atmospheric reanalyses

### Gridded observations

### Station observations
No data on THREDDS

### Forecasts
Not a priority for now, only one dataset.
